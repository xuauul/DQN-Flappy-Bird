# AI Learns to Play Flappy Bird with DQN

## About this project

This project used a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn about playing the [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io) game.

This project used [PyGame Learning Environment (PLE)](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to build the environment for reinforcement learning (RL) model training in Python.

The neural network in this project was implemented using Tenserflow 2.0.
